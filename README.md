# Calculate-Pi-to-Nth-Digit
Calculate Pi to Nth Digit

#Explaination
This program Calcualtes PI to the Nth Digit.  For an accurate Calculation one must input a fairly large digit to caluclate to.  Smaller Digits will not yeild the classic 3.14xxxx result.

#Known Problems
Browsers only execute X decimal points.  They have what is called 'Automatic Rounding'.  In addition the maximum amount of decimal digits JS can compute is 15.  With that said this program only outputs 16 numeral digits 3.(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15).

I am still trying to come up with a way to compute and output more than 15 decimal digits.
